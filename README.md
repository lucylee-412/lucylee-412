I am a recent graduate with a BS in Computer Science, looking for full-time employment as a software engineer.  
My previous projects have largely dealt with web development and project management, but I am eager to expand my horizons and explore other fields (e.g., data science, AI learning).  
  
Pinned below are some of the group projects I have worked on in bootcamps the past two years, the most notable ones being Meopets, my TTP bootcamp capstone, and NYCare, my Hack Brooklyn 2021 submission.  
Both were completed on tight schedules: the capstone, a number of days, and the hackathon entry, under 48 hours.  
I learned a lot about working together with strong teammates who have differing opinions, and how to improve my skills under pressure.
