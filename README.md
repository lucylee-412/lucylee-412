I am a junior software engineer working at nuArch, a small consultant firm. I recently graduated with a BS in computer science.
My previous projects have largely dealt with web development and project management, but I am eager to expand my horizons and explore other fields (e.g., data science, AI learning).  
  
Pinned below are some of the group projects I have worked on in bootcamps or in school — the most notable ones being Meopets, my TTP bootcamp capstone, and NYCare, my Hack Brooklyn 2021 submission.  
Both were completed on tight schedules: the capstone, a number of days, and the hackathon entry, under 48 hours.  
Through these projects, I learned a lot about working together with talented individuals who have differing opinions, and meeting deadlines under pressure.  
I'm looking forward to bringing my sharpened skills to the table at my future company!
